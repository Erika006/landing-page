15 July 2024 - Creating my first landing page with guidance from TOP.
Lots of challenges, whereby I had to visualize the boxes surrounding the elements and really visualizing how I wanted them to be stacked or be beside each other.
At one point, it became confusing of why certain 'padding' and 'margins' did not move the way I wanted to but still managed to do the placing correctly. (thought not exactly sure if it will actually affect the way the webpage becomes)
Another challenge was also to correctly 'group' the elements together to form boxes outside of another box to allow me to 'shift' certain things around.
Overall, a really fun project.
